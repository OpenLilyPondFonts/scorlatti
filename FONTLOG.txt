FONTLOG for the Scorlatti font
=============================

This file provides detailed information on the Scorlatti Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Scorlatti fonts and any derivative works.


Basic font information
----------------------
Scorlatti is a typeface designed by Abraham Lee to resemble the notation style of the famous SCORE music notation program by Leland Smith. No official font software was available for his designs, so the the glyphs in this font are created via outlined scans from original works of SCORE. This font software is not designed for use in a word-processing application, although all the glyphs may be accessed at their respective Unicode points. It was originally designed for use with LilyPond, the automatic music engraver.
